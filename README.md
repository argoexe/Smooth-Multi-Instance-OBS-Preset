# Smooth-Wall/Multi-Instance-OBS-Preset
Made by argo#6969 :)

IMPORTANT:
Install this transition plugin or it WILL NOT WORK: https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move-transition.913/

I have also added an option for game capture or window capture depending on what you like :).
If you play on windowed and you have black bars at the bottom just hit Ctrl + E and change the scale to 1920 by 1080 or whatever you sceen resolution is.

Steps to install:
1. Download the zip and extract it using whatever software you have
2. Go to OBS and then click Scene Collection --> Import --> 3 dots

3. Find the folder where the preset is and then select the json file called "Smooth_Multi"
4. Now that it's imported you want to select the preset by hitting Scene Collection --> Smooth Multi
