(OUTDATED BUT STILL HAS BASIC OBS SETUP)
**IMPORTANT:**
Install [Source Record Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-record.1285/) or open 2 obs instances if you want to use the source record presets, otherwise it won't be verifiable. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE: You need to change the video path for the source record filter, otherwise it won't work. The setup video will show how to do this.** 

**Pay Attention to the Naming:**
- "no_source_record" means you don't need to use the source record plugin, if it's not on the file name, then source record plugin is required.
- "fullscreen" means the preset is meant for fullscreen users, if it's not on the file name, it's meant for borderless/windowed users.
- If there's none of those on the file name, it's a preset for borderless/windowed and requires source record plugin.

**Planning to add**
- Lock indicators
- Higher instance count presets

Steps to install:
1. Download the .json file for whatever instance count you have + no source record/fullscreen etc.
2. Go to OBS and then click Scene Collection --> Import --> 3 dots

3. Find the folder where the preset is and then select the json file that you downloaded
4. Now that it's imported you want to select the preset by hitting Scene Collection --> (inst count) inst multiwall
