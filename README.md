# Smooth-Wall/Multi-Instance-OBS-Preset
Made by argo#6969 and ChezBruhger#5969 :)

[Setup Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfa1HlNF62Y)

IMPORTANT:
Install [Source Record Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-record.1285/) or open 2 obs instances, these presets weren't made for one obs. Instead go to [One Obs Presets](https://github.com/ChezBruhger/Wall-OBS-Presets-No-Source-Record) (currently WIP but it'll be finished eventually)

IMPORTANT NOTE: You need to change the video path for the source record filter, otherwise it won't work. The setup video will show how to do this. 

Install [Move Transition Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move-transition.913/) or smooth animations WILL NOT WORK.
You can use this without smooth transition plugin if you prefer a default obs transition like slide. 

Steps to install:
1. Download the zip and extract it using whatever software you have
2. Go to OBS and then click Scene Collection --> Import --> 3 dots

3. Find the folder where the preset is and then select the json file called "Smooth_Multi"
4. Now that it's imported you want to select the preset by hitting Scene Collection --> Smooth Multi
